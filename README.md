# CRAPS Microprocessor

A minimalistic FPGA CRAPS microprocessor implemented in SHDL* and designed in a RISC architecture which is a reduced computing instruction set. <br />
This was an educational project directed by [Jean-Christophe Buisson](https://amazon.fr/stores/Jean-Christophe-Buisson/author/B004N2KQXM) at ENSEEIHT and I really enjoyed working on it to discover progamming logical logic circuits and how microprocessors work.

## Specifications

### SHDL

## How it works

The CRAPS microprocessor is deisgned around a deliberately minimalistic architecture.
The instruction set is designed to represent the simplest form of computing operations for basic tasks. <br />

This microprocessor features: 
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) : handles basic arithmetic operations listed below
- Sequencer & Program Counter (PC) : sequentially executes instructions in memory
